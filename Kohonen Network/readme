We were supposed to form a Kohonen network with 100 neurons arranged in the form of a two- dimensional lattice with 10 rows and 10 columns and use 1500 randomly generated neutrons to train our model.
Lastly we use the following test set to test our created Kohonen Network. X1=[0.1 0.8]T, X2=[0.5 -0.2]T, X3=[-0.8 -0.9]T, X4=[-0.0.6 0.9]T.

Further, you can refer the report.
