We are given set A and B as follows,
Set A:
• X1 = [1 1 1 1 1 1]
• X2 = [-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1]
• X3 = [1 -1 -1 1 1 1]
• X4 = [1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1]
Set B:
• Y1 = [1 1 1]
• Y2 = [-1 -1 -1]
• Y3 = [-1 1 1]
• Y4 = [1 -1 1]
We are to use BAM algorithm, to train a Weight matrix for BAM which can retrieve all the above mentioned 4 pairs.
Further, test the level of weight corrections of the BAM with examples.

Further explanation is provided in report
